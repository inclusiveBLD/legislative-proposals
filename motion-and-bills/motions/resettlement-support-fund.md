### **PLATEAU STATE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY**  
**NOTICE OF MOTION:** 
 
**ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERIM IDP RESETTLEMENT SUPPORT FUND AND DATA VERIFICATION EXERCISE**  

**Mr. Speaker,**  
**Honourable Members,**  

Pursuant to Sections 14(1)(2)(b) and 17(2)(d)(c) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) mandating security, welfare, and dignity for citizens; and whereas thousands of Plateau citizens remain internally displaced from ancestral homes under dire conditions with destroyed livelihoods; concerned that the absence of verified data on displaced persons and their ancestral land claims obstructs effective resettlement planning;  

**NOW THEREFORE, I CALL ON THIS HOUSE TO RESOLVE AND MANDATE THE PLATEAU STATE GOVERNMENT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY TO:**  

1. **Establish an Interim IDP Resettlement Support Fund** to provide:  
   I. Immediate humanitarian relief (food, shelter, medical aid).  
   II. Livelihood recovery support.  
   III. Rebuilding materials for displaced persons cleared for return.  

2. **Conduct a Comprehensive Data Verification Exercise** through:  
   I. Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management,  
   II. Local Government Councils, and  
   III. Traditional Institutions  
   to:  
   I. Document all IDPsâ€™ communities of origin and ancestral land claims.  
   II. Verify specific needs for dignified return.  
   III. Produce actionable data for resettlement planning.  

**I so move.**
