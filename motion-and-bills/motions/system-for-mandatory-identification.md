### **PLATEAU STATE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY**  
**NOTICE OF MOTION:** 
 
**A CALL TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM FOR MANDATORY IDENTIFICATION, REGISTRATION, AND OWNERSHIP VERIFICATION OF LIVESTOCK IN PLATEAU STATE TO CURB RUSTLING AND RELATED DISPUTES**  

**Mr. Speaker,**  
**Honourable Members,**  

Pursuant to Section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) mandating security and welfare of citizens; and whereas cattle rustling, false ownership claims, and illegal livestock trade devastate livelihoods, fuel inter-communal conflicts, and cripple agriculture; concerned that arbitrary seizures by security agents and coercion of community leaders to "fish out thieves" violate rights and escalate tensions;  

**NOW THEREFORE, I CALL ON THIS HOUSE TO RESOLVE AND MANDATE THE PLATEAU STATE GOVERNMENT AND SECURITY AGENCIES WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY TO:**  

1. **Establish a Central Livestock Database** under the Ministry of Agriculture to:  
   I. Issue **biometric identification** (ear tags/microchips) for all cattle, sheep, and goats.  
   II. Maintain a **digital registry** linking livestock to verified owners.  
   III. Provide **Livestock Ownership Certificates** as prima facie proof.  

2. **Enforce Strict Penalties**:  
   I. **Imprisonment of not less than 20 years** for rustling with full victim restitution.  
   II. **Imprisonment of not less than 10 years or a fine of not less than â‚¦5 million** for false ownership claims.  
   III. Criminalize **tampering with IDs** and **slaughter/sale of unregistered livestock**.  

3. **Delineate Stakeholder Roles**:  
   I. **Security agencies** (Police/Army/NSCDC) to:  
      - Exclusively handle investigations/seizures.  
      - Verify ownership within **48 hours** of seizure.  
      - Resolve disputes within **7 days**.  
   II. **Community leaders** (Ward Heads/Ardos) to:  
      - Gather credible intelligence.  
      - Mediate minor disputes.  
      - **Barred from forced investigations or "fishing out thieves."**  

4. **Compensate victims** of unlawful seizures and fund **humane custody** of disputed livestock.  
5. **Launch awareness campaigns** statewide on the new system.  

**I so move.**
