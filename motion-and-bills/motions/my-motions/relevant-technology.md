**Mr. Speaker,**  
**Honourable Members,**  

WHEREAS, Sections 14(2)(b) and 16(1)(d) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) mandate the State to ensure the security, welfare and economic development of citizens;  

AND WHEREAS, the Plateau State Vocational and Relevant Technology Board established in 1974 has been a vital center for technical skills acquisition and youth empowerment but now suffers from obsolete facilities and underfunding;  

CONCERNED THAT, the current state of the Board fails to meet modern technological standards, leaving Plateau youths without competitive skills in today's digital economy;

**NOW THEREFORE, I CALL ON THIS HOUSE TO RESOLVE AND MANDATE THE PLATEAU STATE GOVERNMENT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY TO:**  

1. **Repeal the Plateau State Vocational and Relevant Technology Board Edict No.8 of 1987** and enact a new law reflecting current technological realities;  

2. **Allocate substantial funding** to:  
   I. Upgrade training facilities with modern equipment  
   II. Train instructors on emerging technologies

3. **Integrate the Board's programs** with:  
   I. National Film Institute (NFI) Jos

4. **Present an implementation roadmap** within 90 days showing:  
   I. Phased rehabilitation plan
