### **PLATEAU STATE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY**  
**NOTICE OF MOTION:** 
 
**A CALL TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM FOR MANDATORY IDENTIFICATION, REGISTRATION, AND OWNERSHIP VERIFICATION OF LIVESTOCK IN PLATEAU STATE TO CURB RUSTLING AND RELATED DISPUTES**  

**Mr. Speaker,**  
**Honourable Members,**  

Pursuant to Sections 14(2)(b) and 17(2)(c) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) which mandate government to ensure security, welfare, and dignity of citizens, and considering the devastating impact of cattle rustling, false ownership claims, and illegal livestock trade on livelihoods, inter-communal relations, and agricultural productivity across Plateau State; with particular concern about arbitrary seizures by security agents and coercive pressures on community leaders to "fish out thieves" without due process – which violate fundamental rights and escalate tensions;  

**NOW THEREFORE, I CALL ON THIS HOUSE TO RESOLVE AND MANDATE THE PLATEAU STATE GOVERNMENT AND SECURITY AGENCIES WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY TO:**  

1. **Establish a Central Livestock Database** through the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to issue biometric identification (ear tags/microchips) and Livestock Ownership Certificates as prima facie proof of ownership.  
2. **Enforce Strict Penalties** including:  
   - Minimum 20-year imprisonment for rustling with full victim restitution.  
   - 10-year imprisonment or ₦5 million fines for false ownership claims.  
3. **Delineate Stakeholder Roles**:  
   - Security agencies (Police/Army/NSCDC) to exclusively handle investigations/seizures within 48-hour verification windows.  
   - Community leaders (Ward Heads/Ardos) limited to intelligence gathering – barred from forced investigations.  
4. **Compensate owners** for losses from unlawful seizures and fund humane custody of disputed livestock.  
5. **Launch public awareness campaigns** on the new registration system statewide.  

**I so move.**
