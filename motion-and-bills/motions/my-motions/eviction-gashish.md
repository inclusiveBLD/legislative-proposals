### **PLATEAU STATE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY**  
**NOTICE OF MOTION:**  

**URGENT DEPLOYMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY FORCES AND EVICTION OF ILLEGAL OCCUPANTS IN GASHISH DISTRICT AND OTHER AFFECTED COMMUNITIES**  

**Mr. Speaker,**  
**Honourable Members,**  

Pursuant to Section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) mandating security and welfare of citizens; and whereas communities in Gashish District, Barkin Ladi LGA, and other parts of Plateau State remain forcibly displaced from ancestral homes with lands illegally occupied, rendering return perilous; aware that despite the Mobile Police Barracks in Gashish, pervasive occupation without eviction prevents safe return; concerned that illegal occupation fuels violence and blocks reconciliation;  

**NOW THEREFORE, I CALL ON THIS HOUSE TO RESOLVE AND MANDATE THE PLATEAU STATE GOVERNMENT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY TO:**  

1. **Engage Federal Government and Security Agencies** (Military/Police/Civil Defence) to:  
   I. Deploy comprehensive security to Gashish District and all affected communities.  
   II. Secure entire land areas beyond static checkpoints.  
   III. Immediately evict illegal occupants and protect returning indigenes.  

2. **Establish a 60-Day Emergency Land Task Force** comprising:  
   I. Ministry of Land and Survey,  
   II. Ministry of Justice,  
   III. Traditional Institutions, and  
   IV. Affected Communities  
   to:  
   I. Audit occupied ancestral lands transparently,  
   II. Verify original ownership,  
   III. Submit restitution report for executive action.  

3. **Initiate Federal Dialogue** to prioritize security strategy for indigenous return.  

**I so move.**
