### **KEY IMPROVEMENTS VS. PROPOSAL**  
| **Original Proposal** | **Legislative Solution** |  
|------------------------|--------------------------|  
| Vague revenue model (₦800m projections) | **Realistic funding streams**: Cinema levies, certification fees |  
| Duplicate director roles | **Streamlined governance**: 4 specialized directors |  
| No oversight mechanisms | **Mandatory audits + legislative reporting** |  
| Ambiguous cultural mandate | **Explicit cultural preservation** (Annual festivals, indigenous content) |  
| Salary structure in proposal | **Removed**: To be set by Civil Service Commission |  

---

### **STRATEGIC VALUE**  
1. **Economic**:  
   - Creates jobs for NFI Jos graduates and local artists.  
   - Attracts film tourism (e.g., "Return to Joswood" initiative).  
2. **Cultural**:  
   - Prevents erosion of Plateau’s cinematic legacy (NTA Jos, *Cockcrow at Dawn*).  
3. **Fiscal Discipline**:  
   - Transparent allocation: ≤30% operational costs vs. 50% in proposal.  

> **Recommendation**: Retain BODMOS Media as **Technical Adviser** during implementation (Section 6 of proposal) but exclude from governance to prevent conflict of interest.

**I so move.**
